Air Quality Monitoring System is a web-based application designed to visualize and analyze air pollution data using interactive maps, comparison tools, and graphical indicators.
The system provides users with insights into pollutant levels like PM2.5 and PM10, represented through AQI (Air Quality Index) visuals and informative dashboards.

It features a clean, responsive user interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to explore air quality metrics across different locations and timeframes.
Users can log in to access personalized views, compare environmental trends, and better understand the impact of pollution.

This was presented at the Hack For Earth Hackathon at COP28.
